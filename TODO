# TODO

Based on the provided files and their current state, here's what still needs to be updated or addressed:

1. tests/cleaning/test_manual_cleaning.py and tests/cleaning/test_cleaner.py:
   - These test files might need to be created or updated to match the new async structure of the cleaning modules.

2. tests/importing/test_memgraph.py:
   - This test file might need to be created or updated to test the new async MemgraphImporter class.

3. src/cleaning/cleaner.py:
   - This file might need further review to ensure it's fully aligned with the manual_cleaning.py structure and using the new config properly.

4. src/importing/csv_prep.py:
   - The main() function is still synchronous. Consider making it async to match the pattern of other modules.

5. tests/processing/test_unwrap.py:
   - This file might need updates to test the new async methods in the Unwrapper class.

6. requirements.txt:
   - This file wasn't shown in the provided files, but it should be updated to include all necessary dependencies, including asyncio, aiofiles, and any other new libraries used.

7. .gitignore:
   - This file wasn't shown, but it should be checked to ensure it's properly ignoring cache files, logs, and other non-version controlled files.

8. setup.py or pyproject.toml:
   - These files weren't shown, but one of them should be created or updated for proper packaging of the project.

9. CI/CD configuration:
    - If you're using any CI/CD tools, their configuration files should be updated to run the new async tests and handle the new project structure.

10. src/process.py:
    - This file looks good, but you might want to add more detailed logging or progress reporting as it runs through each stage of the pipeline.

11. Documentation:
    - Consider adding more inline documentation or docstrings to the new async methods, especially in complex classes like MemgraphImporter.

Remember to run all tests after making these updates to ensure everything is working as expected with the new async structure and config system.
